# CS-250-Sprint-Review-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  The user stories create a tangible "action item" that allows the product owner and development team to create features
  that they themselves or, in this instance, a user of the product/service, would like to see. Providing a high level overview
  of what ultimately would be part of the final product. The "user stories" help create "bite-sized" goals where the team can 
  focus on development of the product without having to worry about the full scope of it until it unfolds itself as the project
  continues and evolves. Some "user stories" will require a lot of input and clarity from other stakeholders that might 
  ultimately shift the focus of the initial product to better serve the customers that they aim to please. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  The way that I approach developing programs is with burn-down charts. Alongside that I plan to incorporate agile methodoligy
  into my day-to-day development. Navigating ambiguity has always been one of my strong suits so therefore it feels natural
  to not have to have everything tied down  in a neat bow but rather starting in strong and slowly defining the lines of 
  the product. The biggest agile processes that I plan to incorporate into my work are "lean" and "extreme programming" given
  that I always strive to do work that is efficient and hold a high standard to myself and others that work around me. 
  Delivering quality code that works everytime is very important to me. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member in software development is knowing when to lead and when to follow. It also means knowing
  when to ask for help or when you should be open to new ideas. Software development is a group effort and not a single
  developer, no matter how talented, can ever achieve what a good, collaborative, and transparent team can hope to achieve.
  Having a leadership that strives to have a servant mindset and provide visitiblity to other stakeholders as well as 
  guidance and support to those who choose to provide feedback and speak up is critical as well. Following the 12 principles
  of the agile manifesto is definitely a good foundation to any software development team, or any team in general.
